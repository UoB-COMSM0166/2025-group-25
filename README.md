| **Only Real Men Can Reach 100 Floors**           | Vertical Action Platformer       | Players control a character descending an endless tower. The goal is to reach the 100th floor as quickly as possible while avoiding obstacles and collecting items through quick reflexes and strategic decision-making. Each floor presents a unique challenge.                                                                                     | - **Floors**<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;• Normal Floor: Safe landing.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;• Fragile Floor: Breaks after a short duration.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;• Moving Floor: Moves horizontally.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;• Spiked Floor: Instant death upon contact.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;• Bouncy Floor: Launches the character to lower floors.<br><br> 1. Quick reactions are essential as the tower background continuously scrolls upward (time constraint).<br>2. This dynamic creates tension, inspiring high-difficulty designs. | 1. Quick reactions are essential as the tower background continuously scrolls upward. The screen's upper edge features deadly spikes, which will kill the character if touched, introducing a time constraint.  
2. This dynamic creates tension and inspires high-difficulty level designs for later stages of our game, enhancing the game's challenge and excitement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Pac-Man**                                       | Arcade                           | Players control Pac-Man, navigating a maze to eat all the pellets on the map while avoiding four ghost enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde). If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, the game ends.<br><br>**Scoring System**:<br>- Eating regular pellets = basic points<br>- Consuming “Power Pellets” lets Pac-Man temporarily eat ghosts for bonus points.<br><br>**Enemy AI**: Each ghost exhibits unique movement patterns (chasing, ambushing, random). | - **Level Progression**: Ghosts become faster and smarter as levels increase.<br>- **Failure Condition**: Game ends when Pac-Man loses all lives.<br><br>Pac-Man’s simple mechanics revolve around **avoiding ghosts** and **consuming pellets**. Strategic movement is key, as each ghost has a distinct AI that challenges the player differently.                                                                                                          | 1. **Dynamic Challenge Through AI**: Varied ghost behaviors inspire reactive, strategic challenges.<br>2. **Reward & Feedback Loops**: Eating ghosts for bonus points keeps players engaged.<br>3. **Tension & Pacing**: Increasing ghost speed elevates intensity.<br>4. **Simple Rules, Deep Gameplay**: Minimal mechanics yield complex strategies, showing depth doesn’t require over-complication.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Bomberman**                                     | Arcade                           | Players control a character navigating a maze by placing bombs to destroy obstacles and enemies. Collect power-ups to increase bomb strength, speed, or capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                   | - **Strategic Bomb Placement**: Eliminate obstacles/enemies without harming yourself.<br>- **Dynamic Hazards**: Explosions can temporarily alter the maze, forcing quick adaptation.<br>- **Timed Objectives**: Clear levels and find hidden exits before time runs out, balancing exploration and survival under pressure.                                                                                                                                          | 1. **Tension through Dynamic Hazards**: Bomb explosions create chain reactions, inspiring interactive level design.<br>2. **Reward Systems**: Power-ups provide progression, motivating exploration and growth.<br>3. **Urgency via Timed Goals**: Time limits increase pressure for quick decisions.<br>4. **Puzzle-Solving with Simple Mechanics**: Intuitive bomb placement leads to complex tactical and puzzle scenarios.                                                                                                                                         |
| **PICO PARK**                                     | Cooperative Puzzle-Platformer    | A cooperative puzzle-platformer for 2–8 players. Collect keys, stack on each other, and step on switches to unlock exits. Each level features unique puzzles, requiring real-time teamwork and communication. With simple rules and controls, it’s perfect for casual or online sessions.                                                               | - **Key Collecting**: All keys are required to open exits, demanding synced movement.<br>- **Stacking & Synchronization**: Some puzzles require stacking or pressing switches in unison.<br>- **Team-based Physics**: Multiple players moving simultaneously can alter physics (jump heights, balance points). A single misstep can lead to group failure.                                                                                               | 1. **Co-op & Communication**: Mandatory teamwork adds a layer of social fun to platformers.<br>2. **Varied Levels & Progressive Difficulty**: Each stage has a unique gimmick, steadily ramping up challenges.<br>3. **Player Interaction & Fun Factor**: Real-time coordination often leads to lively, humorous moments, suggesting multiplayer or local co-op is a strong draw for similarly styled platformers.                                                                                                                                             |
| **The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening**         | Action-Adventure Platformer      | A unique Zelda chapter where Link finds himself on a mysterious island after a storm. The game blends exploration, puzzle-solving, collection, and combat. Each area is filled with secrets and formidable enemies, offering diverse environments like beaches, forests, mountains, and swamps.                                                         | - **Diverse Environments**: Varied locales with unique challenges and visuals.<br>- **Item System**: Items enable new abilities (e.g., feather for jumping, heavy boots for sand/swamps).<br>- **Intelligent Enemies & Bosses**: Each boss has specific weaknesses to discover.<br>- **Puzzle Elements**: Ranging from simple levers to complex environmental puzzles requiring observation and item usage.                                                                                                   | 1. **Environmental Interaction & Platform Elements**: Encourages leveraging interactive backdrops, inspiring deeper platform mechanics.<br>2. **Rich Layered Exploration**: Detailed level designs that reward thorough exploration could benefit Mario-like titles.<br>3. **Enemy & Combat Mechanics**: Diverse foes with different weaknesses drive more varied and challenging encounters.<br>4. **Integration of Puzzles & Items**: Puzzle-solving with unique items fosters a more immersive, engaging experience. |
