| **Only Real Men Can Reach 100 Floors**      | Vertical Action Platformer      | Players control a character descending an endless tower. The goal is to reach the 100th floor as quickly as possible while avoiding obstacles and collecting items through quick reflexes and strategic decision-making. Each floor presents a unique challenge.                       | **Floors** <br>- Normal Floor: Safe landing. <br>- Fragile Floor: Breaks after a short duration. <br>- Moving Floor: Moves horizontally, requiring precise timing to jump. <br>- Spiked Floor: Instant death upon contact. <br>- Bouncy Floor: Launches the character to lower floors. <br><br> **Key Points** <br>1. Quick reactions are essential as the tower background continuously scrolls upward, creating a time constraint. <br>2. The screen’s upper edge has deadly spikes that will kill the character if touched, leading to high-difficulty level designs. | 由于该不断上升的背景和时间压力，“速战速决”的紧张感可激发玩家的肾上腺素，并且鼓励高难度关卡设计，提升游戏挑战与刺激性。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Pac-Man**                                 | Arcade                          | Players control Pac-Man, navigating a maze to eat all the pellets on the map while avoiding four ghost enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde).                                                                                                                                             | - If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, the game ends. <br><br> **Scoring System** <br>- Eating regular pellets provides basic points. <br>- Consuming “Power Pellets” temporarily allows Pac-Man to eat ghosts for bonus points. <br><br> **Enemy AI** <br>- Each ghost has unique movement patterns (chasing, ambushing, random). <br><br> **Level Progression** <br>- Ghosts become faster and smarter as levels increase. <br><br> **Failure Condition** <br>- Game over when Pac-Man loses all lives. | 1. **Dynamic Challenge Through AI Behavior**: Unique ghost behaviors create strategic depth.<br>2. **Reward and Feedback Loops**: Bonus points for eating ghosts keep players engaged.<br>3. **Tension and Pacing**: Increasing speed of ghosts raises intensity.<br>4. **Simple Rules with Deep Gameplay**: Demonstrates how minimal mechanics can yield complex strategies.                                                                                                       |
| **Bomberman**                               | Arcade                          | Players control a character navigating a maze by placing bombs to destroy obstacles and enemies. Collect power-ups to increase bomb strength, speed, or capacity.                                                                                                                         | - **Strategic Bomb Placement**: Carefully place bombs to eliminate barriers/enemies while avoiding self-damage. <br>- **Dynamic Hazards**: Each explosion changes the maze temporarily, forcing quick adaptations. <br>- **Timed Objectives**: Must find hidden exits and clear levels before the timer runs out.                                                                                                                          | 1. **Tension through Dynamic Hazards**: Chain reactions and interactive environments. <br>2. **Reward Systems**: Power-ups drive exploration and progression. <br>3. **Urgency through Timed Goals**: Time constraints demand quick decisions. <br>4. **Puzzle-Solving with Simple Mechanics**: Intuitive bomb placement leading to complex puzzle solutions.                                                                                                  |
| **PICO PARK**                               | Cooperative Puzzle-Platformer   | PICO PARK is a cooperative puzzle-platformer for 2–8 players. Collect keys, stack on each other, and step on switches to unlock exits. Each level features unique puzzles that encourage real-time communication and teamwork. With simple rules/controls, it’s perfect for casual fun. | - **Key Collecting**: Retrieve keys to open exits, requiring synced movements. <br>- **Stacking & Synchronization**: Some levels demand players to stack or stand on switches simultaneously. <br>- **Team-based Physics**: Multiple players moving at once alters jump heights or balance, so missteps can cause failures.                                                                                                                | 1. **Co-op & Communication**: Mandatory cooperation adds an extra layer of team-based fun. <br>2. **Varied Levels & Progressive Difficulty**: Each level has a unique gimmick, ramping up steadily. <br>3. **Player Interaction & Fun Factor**: Real-time teamwork and social interaction become core selling points, suggesting multiplayer or co-op elements for similar platformers.                                                                     |
